## About Me

My name is Veronica Flores and I am a rising sophomore majoring in Computer Science & Engineering from Santa Clara University in California. I am also double minoring in Mathematics and Political Science and plan to graduate in Spring 2025. In the past, I have researched at [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu/) under the advice of Dr.Stephen Ramsey in the *[ramseylab](https://lab.saramsey.org/)* through the Department of Biological Science in the [School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/). In 2020, I was an Oregon and SW Washington Affiliate Award Winner of the [NCWIT Award for Aspirations in Computing](https://www.aspirations.org/award-programs/apply-for-the-award-for-aic). Moreover, this Summer, I am researching in the Vision, Language, and Learning Lab at Rice University through the CRA-WP DREU Program. My host is Associate Professor Vicente Ordóñez-Román from the Department of Computer Science at Rice University.

Professor Vicente Ordóñez-Román's official bio lies in his lab's *[website](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~vo9/)*.                     
 
Dr. Vicente Ordóñez-Román is an Associate Professor in Department of Computer Science at Rice University where he leads the **[Vision, Learning, and Language Lab](https://www.vislang.ai/)**, and is a Amazon Visiting Academic at Amazon Alexa AI.
From 2016-2021 he was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Virginia. In the past, he has also been visiting
professor at Adobe Research and visiting researcher at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2). He received his PhD in Computer Science at
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2015 advised by Prof. Tamara L. Berg, an MS in Computer Science at Stony Brook University (SUNY) and
an engineering degree at the Escuela Superior Politécnica del Litoral in Ecuador. He's a recipient of a Best -Long- Paper Award at the 2017 Conference on
Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), and the Best Paper Marr Prize at the 2013 International Conference in Computer Vision (ICCV).
He has also received an NSF CAREER Award, an IBM Faculty Award, a Google Faculty Research Award, and a Facebook Research Award. Here is a link to an official [bio](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~vo9/bio.txt), and his [curriculum vitae](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~vo9/cv_vicente.pdf).

## About My Project

This summer, I am researching vision and language models used in machine learning. These models use natural language processing and computer vision in order to identify various images and text outputs. Specifically, my project will explore societal biases in large scale models trained with contrastive objects. By the end of the summer, I hope to have detected where bias lies in one of these models using original experimental behavioral tests and analyzing the results for possible solutions to these biases.             
<br/>
The machine learning model we will be using is the **[CLIP Model](https://openai.com/blog/clip/)**, which is trained via natural language supervision. The CLIP model uses a Byte-Pair encoding tokenizer and is a dual-stream Vision Transformer (ViT). For my project we will be creating an experiment and metrics in order to evaluate the CLIP model for further bias. The Experimental Setup is TBD currently but this section will be updated when it is final! However, feel free to check my blog for weekly updates down below!

## About the DREU Progam

The [Distributed Research Experiences for Undergraduates](https://cra.org/cra-wp/dreu/) (DREU) program aims to increase the diversity of computer science/engineering graduate students by matching students with faculty mentors at institutions across the United States for a 10-week, fully funded summer research experience. DREU is organized by the Computing Research Association’s Committee on Widening Participation in Computing Research (CRA-WP) and supported by the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503593).
