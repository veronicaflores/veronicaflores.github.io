## About Me

My name is Veronica Flores and I am a rising sophomore majoring in Computer Science & Engineering from Santa clara University in California. 
I am also double minoring in Mathematics and Political Science and plan to graduate in Spring 2025. 
In the past, I have researched at [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu/) under the advice of Dr.Stephen Ramsey in the *[ramseylab](https://lab.saramsey.org/)* through the
Department of Biological Science in the [School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/).
This Summer, I am researching in the Vision, Language, and Learning Lab at Rice University through the CRA-WP DREU Program. 
My host is Associate Professor Vicente Ordóñez-Román from
the Department of Computer Science at Rice University.

Professor Vicente Ordóñez-Román's official bio lies in his lab's website: https://www.cs.rice.edu/~vo9/ <br/>
<br/>
          
Dr. Vicente Ordóñez-Román is an Associate Professor in Department of Computer Science at Rice University where he leads the **[Vision, Learning, and Language Lab](https://www.vislang.ai/)**, and is a Amazon Visiting Academic at Amazon Alexa AI.
From 2016-2021 I was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Virginia. In the past, I have also been visiting
professor at Adobe Research and visiting researcher at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2). I received my PhD in Computer Science at
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2015 advised by Prof. Tamara L. Berg, an MS in Computer Science at Stony Brook University (SUNY) and
an engineering degree at the Escuela Superior Politécnica del Litoral in Ecuador. I'm a recipient of a Best -Long- Paper Award at the 2017 Conference on
Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), and the Best Paper Marr Prize at the 2013 International Conference in Computer Vision (ICCV).
I have also received an NSF CAREER Award, an IBM Faculty Award, a Google Faculty Research Award, and a Facebook Research Award. Here is a link to an official bio, and my curriculum vitae.

## About My Project

This summer, I plan to focus on image bias removal and analysis evaluating image and text retrieval. My goal is to detect where there is bias, maybe in gender or superirority, within vision and language machine learning modules and begin brainstorming solutions to these biases. The machine learning model we will be using is the **[CLIP Model](https://openai.com/blog/clip/)**, which is trained via natural language supervision. The CLIP model uses a Byte-Pair encoding tokenizer and is a dual-stream Vision Transformer (ViT). For my project we will be creating an experiment and metrics in order to evaluate the CLIP model for further bias. The Experimental Setup is TBD currently but this section will be updated when it is final!
