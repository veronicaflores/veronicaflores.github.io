## Week 10 (August 29th - September 2nd)

**August 30th:** <br/>  
I can't belive this is the last week of my internship with Professor Vicente, I have had such an amazing time all summer but there is a few things I wrapped up. First, I completed the t-tests for each respective sentiment test. The t-test is a probability score which measures the difference between two datasets. I computed these scores so that we could further analyze the societal biases in the sentiment tests.

**September 2nd:** <br/>  
On this day I finished creating the website for the Image2Text scores. These scores were calculated because from the first PKS we found that focusing in on name and state would allow for better results. Thus, instead of getting a score out of 1, we found the top 5 best matches for name and state for every senate image. The link to this webpage is [here](https://veronicaflores.github.io/image2text-on-senate.html).

Lastly, here are some of my favorite memories of this Summer :)
