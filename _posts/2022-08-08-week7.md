## Week 7 (August 8th - August 12th)

**August 9th:** <br/>  

Today Vicente and I looked over the completed tables I made for all the Basic Tests as well as my progress on the tests that where by gender and political affiliation. My results looked better in terms of the hard tests as the "US representative" text wasn't picked as much by CLIP. For the gender and political affiliation tests my mentor suggested that I also include the number of images for each sub-category. Here is an example of a semi completed table:

Furthermore, I created the google doc that would contain the demographics of all the politicians [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NHBhyhh3_KRQwJAFajz0STcwMBkNhojbgXi5E0LW_F4/edit?usp=sharing). Also, I began drafting the rest of the positive and negative connotations for the sentiment test:

Lastly, the last time we talked about the knowledge tests we talked about only names and states. However, this time we talked about creating 5-10 personal questions and testing the model with them. Moreover, we decided that the sum of these scores would be the the Personal Knowledge Score (PKS) which measures how much the model knows about a particular person. If the model can answer all five questions correctly then we assume the model knows a lot about the person.
