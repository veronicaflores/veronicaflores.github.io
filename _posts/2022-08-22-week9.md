## Week 9 (August 22nd - August 26th)

**August 23rd:** <br/>  
This week unfortunately Vicente and I were not able to meet, but, I was still able to work on the material discussed last week. The first thing I started on was creating plots of each category of sentiment test, this included one plot for the women, one for the men, and one combined for each individual prompt. Since this task was tedious we decided to solely make these plots for the Senate so that we could make sure it was a better way to analyze. Here are some of the results:
